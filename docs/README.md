*Built with 🌾 for Indian agriculture and powered by 🛰️ satellite intelligence*

**Ready to revolutionize farming with space technology!** 🚀
   - Optimal harvest window identification
   - Weather-safe harvesting period recommendations

7. **🌱 Input Materials Agent** *(Following Sprint)*  
   - Satellite-based nutrient deficiency detection
   - Soil health analysis for fertilizer optimization
   - Seed variety recommendations with environmental matching
- **Text Analyzer**: Processes and analyzes text content with sentiment analysis
- **Data Processor**: Enriches and transforms data with statistical analysis  
- **API Client**: Handles external API interactions and data fetching

Each agent reports status changes in real-time to the dashboard.

## Why I Built This

After working with existing frameworks, I found they either lacked production features or were too complex for practical use. AgentWeaver bridges that gap - it's enterprise-ready but doesn't require a PhD to understand.

What makes this different:
- **Real-time visibility**: You can actually see what your agents are doing
- **Works out of the box**: No complex configuration or external dependencies required
- **Production tested**: Handles real workloads with proper error handling
- **Live demos**: Working examples that show the system in action

The real-time dashboard was the game-changer for me - finally being able to see agent coordination happening live made debugging and optimization so much easier.

## Quick Start Demo

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the backend
python main.py

# Terminal 2: Start the frontend  
cd frontend && npm run dev

# Terminal 3: See it in action
python examples/demos/dashboard_demo.py
```

Watch http://localhost:3000 and see your agents spring to life! 🚀
