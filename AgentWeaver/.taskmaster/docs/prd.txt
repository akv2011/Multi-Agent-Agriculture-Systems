# Overview  
AgentWeaver is a sophisticated multi-agent orchestration system built with LangGraph that demonstrates advanced agent communication, supervision, and workflow management. The system is designed to showcase complex agent interactions, hierarchical communication patterns, and robust failure handling mechanisms for enterprise-grade applications.

The project solves the challenge of coordinating multiple AI agents in complex workflows while maintaining state consistency, handling failures gracefully, and enabling dynamic routing based on conditions. This is valuable for organizations looking to implement scalable AI agent systems for tasks like automated customer service, content processing pipelines, or research automation.
